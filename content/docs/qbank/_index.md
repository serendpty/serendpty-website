# Question Bank

Searching for past papers and practice papers online can often be a frustrating experience. While there are numerous sources available, the download links for these papers are often buried amidst a sea of advertisements.

Furthermore, the majority of these resources are scanned images or `.pdf` files containing scanned images of papers. One drawback of this approach is the lack of flexibility. While you can print these papers, the quality of the scan affects the outcome. Additionally, you cannot easily copy and paste questions that interest you from these materials.

At the Question Bank, we strive to provide a better approach. Our platform offers access to a comprehensive database of questions and answers that are properly typeset. Coupled with a fine-grained search function and the ability to output question papers and answer sheets in multiple file formats, we aim to enhance the user experience and provide valuable resources for learners.
