**Most of the time, our current education system feels like it is lagging at least a quarter of a century behind. With time-consuming practices like filling out bulky forms and calculating a student's attendance weekly by hand, to writing long reports that nobody seems to care to have a second look at afterwards.**

**These mundane and often unnecessary tasks cut deep into the time spent teaching by teachers. As a result, the quality of our education is undermined. It would be beneficial if we can reclaim these wasted hours for teachers and students alike, so that they can be better utilized.**

**There is so much room for improvement and so much untapped potential. By utilizing free and open-source software and community-driven initiatives, we can improve the quality of our education system by leaps and bounds at a minimum cost.**
