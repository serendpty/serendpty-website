*Most of the time, our current education system feels like it is lagging at least a quarter of a century behind. With time-consuming practices like filling out bulky forms and calculating a student's attendance weekly by hand, to writing long reports that nobody seems to care to have a second look at afterwards.*

*These mundane and often unnecessary tasks cut deep into the time spent teaching by teachers. As a result, the quality of our education is undermined. It would be beneficial if we can reclaim these wasted hours for teachers and students alike, so that they can be better utilized.*

*There is so much room for improvement and so much untapped potential. By utilizing free and open-source software and community-driven initiatives, we can improve the quality of our education system by leaps and bounds at a minimum cost.*

# What is Serendipity?

> This discovery, indeed, is almost of that kind which I call **Serendipity**, a very expressive word, which, as I have nothing better to tell you, I shall endeavor to explain to you.... I once read a silly fairy tale, called “The Three Princes of Serendip”: as their Highnesses travelled, they were always making discoveries, by accidents and sagacity, of things which they were not in quest of ... now do you understand **Serendipity**?

**Serendipity** is a project whose focus is to provide **free and open-source** software solutions to increase the quality of our education. After all, the quality of our society is nothing but the quality of our education.

We don't try to provide large and complex systems that cover workflows from one end to the other; we prefer building small tools that focus on specific use cases. In other words, we are trying to fill the void with better solutions.

## The Question Bank

Have you ever tried looking for past papers on the internet? Yes, there are many sources where you can find them. However, most of the time, you end up with scanned images (or scanned images compiled into **PDF** files) of papers, and the download links for these papers are buried in pages full of advertisements.

What if we could do better? What if we could:

- Have access to a large database of questions in one place?
- Also obtain answer sheets for those questions?
- Perform a fine-grained search on questions using criteria such as `exam`, `year`, `paper`, and `language`?
- Have all the questions properly typeset using Unicode fonts (no scanned images of typesetted content)?
- Have the ability to download questions and answer sheets in a variety of file formats such as `PDF`, `DOCX`, and `ODT`?
